# CaptureIt

A Windows-only screenshot capture tool (.NET 10, WPF) that runs in the system tray.

## Features

- Runs as a system tray background app — no main window; access via the tray icon's
  right-click menu (**Capture Region**, **Capture Full Screen**, **Settings**, **Exit**).
- Region capture: dimmed overlay across all monitors, drag-to-select, Enter/mouse-release
  to confirm, Esc to cancel.
- Full-screen capture: with multiple monitors, a numbered monitor-picker overlay lets you
  choose which one to capture (skipped automatically with a single monitor).
- A single global hotkey (default **Ctrl+Alt+S**, remappable in Settings) repeats
  whichever mode (region or full-screen) was last used, and pre-shows the last
  region / last monitor so pressing **Enter** re-captures the same selection.
- Optional **capture delay** (Off, 3s, 5s, or 10s, set in Settings): when you start a
  capture, a countdown runs first so you have time to set up a transient UI state
  (open a menu, hover a tooltip); the desktop is frozen the moment the countdown ends
  and you then select the region/monitor. Applies to both region and full-screen
  capture and stays non-blocking in the tray app.
- Screenshots are saved as PNG to a configured folder, using a configurable filename
  pattern (default `Screenshot_{datetime}.png`), with automatic collision suffixing
  (`_001`, `_002`, ...) and automatic fallback to `%Pictures%\CaptureIt` if the
  configured folder becomes unavailable.
- Optional **OCR text extraction** (disabled by default, toggled in Settings): runs
  Windows' built-in OCR (`Windows.Media.Ocr`) on every captured screenshot and saves
  the recognized text next to the image, using the same base filename with a `.txt`
  extension (e.g. `Screenshot_20260705_101500.png` + `Screenshot_20260705_101500.txt`).
  Requires an OCR language pack for one of the user's Windows profile languages; if
  none is installed, or no text is found, no `.txt` file is written and the image save
  itself is unaffected.
- Optional **Save to clipboard** (disabled by default, toggled in Settings): when
  enabled, the capture is placed on the Windows clipboard instead of being written to a
  file. If OCR is also enabled, the recognized **text** is copied to the clipboard;
  otherwise the captured **image** is copied.
- Optional **AI capture** (disabled by default, configured in Settings): connect an
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Base URL, model, and API key — the key is stored securely
  in Windows Credential Manager, never in `settings.json`). Two modes:
  - **Use AI capture** — extracts the captured content as formatted **Markdown**.
  - **Use AI to answer** — answers your configured **Prompt** using the capture as
    context and shows the result in an always-on-top **answer overlay** (dismiss with
    **Enter** or **Esc**) instead of saving a file. The overlay is centered over the
    captured region/monitor and has an **Opacity slider** (bottom-left) to make it more
    or less see-through; the chosen value is remembered in `settings.json` (it is not
    exposed in the Settings window). Optional **MCP tool servers** can be supplied for
    this mode.
- Silent on successful captures; shows a Windows notification only on failures
  (e.g. hotkey conflicts, save-folder problems, OCR errors).
- Settings persisted as JSON at `%AppData%\CaptureIt\settings.json`.

See `docs` in the session history / `plan.md` used during design for the full set of
design decisions and the rubber-duck design review that shaped this implementation
(freeze-first capture model, per-monitor DPI handling, single-instance enforcement, etc.).

## Building

Requires the .NET 10 SDK.

```
dotnet build
```

This project targets `net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0` (WPF + WinForms, plus the Windows
10 2004 WinRT API surface needed for `Windows.Media.Ocr`) and sets
`EnableWindowsTargeting=true` so it can be **restored and compiled** on non-Windows
machines for CI/editing purposes. However, since it uses WPF, WinForms, and Win32
interop (RegisterHotKey, BitBlt, monitor enumeration, etc.), **the app can only be run,
and its tests only executed, on a real Windows machine**. This is a fundamental platform
limitation, not a version issue: `Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App` (the runtime component
that provides WPF/WinForms) is only published for Windows — there is no Linux/macOS
build of it at any .NET version (8, 9, 10, ...), so `dotnet run`/`dotnet test` will
always fail on non-Windows with a "No frameworks were found" error, even though
`dotnet build` succeeds there.

## Running tests

On Windows:

```
dotnet test
```

Tests cover pure logic only (no UI/interop invoked): filename pattern expansion and
sanitization, settings JSON round-tripping and corruption recovery, and the
coordinate math used to crop regions/monitors out of the frozen desktop bitmap
(including negative-coordinate multi-monitor layouts).

## Known limitations (by design, per requirements)

- No auto-start with Windows — launch manually.
- No post-capture toast on success (silent by design).
- Cannot capture the UAC secure desktop or DRM-protected video content (inherent GDI
  capture limitation).
